#### Angular Setup
Create a target in your `angular.json` file. Like the one shown bellow.
Other targets like `lint` or `build` are located in the same place.

*Important* make sure your levels of obfuscation and performance is suitable for your
project! The *default* parameters are most likely *not* what you *want*. 

```json
{
  "obfuscate": {
    "builder": "@rcarver/ngx-source-obfuscation:obfuscate",
    "options": {
      "files": [
        {
          "glob": "main*.js",
          "input": "www",
          "output": "www"
        }
      ],
      "sourceMap": true,
      "sourceMapMode": "separate"
    },
    "configurations": {
      "production": {
